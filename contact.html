    <p>For bookings, the best and quickest way to confirm a reservation is through the bookings page of the website. If you are unable to make a booking this way, email info@lilacwine.co.uk or call the number below. We are a small team with no dedicated receptionist, so if we are unable to pick up the phone, text the number below and we will do our best to call you back (don't leave a message as we won't listen to it) or pop in during opening hours.</p>
